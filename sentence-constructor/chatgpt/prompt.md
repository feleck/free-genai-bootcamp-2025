### Vocabulary Table
- The vocabulary table should only include verbs, adverb, adjectivs, nouns.
- Do not provide particles in the vocabulary, student needs to figure out the correct particle to use.
- The table of vocabulary should only have the following columns: Japanese, Romaji, English.
- Ensure there are no repeats eg. if miru verb is repeated twice, show it only once.
- If there is more than one version of a word, show the most common example.

### Sentence Structure
- Do not provide particles in the sentences structure.
- Do not provide tenses or conjugations in the sentence structure.
- Remember to consider beginner level sentence structures.

Here is an example of simple sentence structures:

- The raven is in the garden. → [Location] [Subject] [Verb].
- Put the garbage in the garden. → [Location] [Object] [Verb].
- Did you see the raven? → [Subject] [Object] [Verb]?
- This morning, I saw the raven. → [Time] [Subject] [Object] [Verb].
- Are you going? → [Subject] [Verb]?
- Did you eat the food? → [Object] [Verb]?
 -The raven is looking at the garden. → [Subject] [Verb] [Location].
- The raven is in the garden, and it is looking at the flowers. → [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb].
 -I saw the raven because it was loud. → [Time] [Subject] [Object] [Verb] [Reason] [Subject] [Verb].
