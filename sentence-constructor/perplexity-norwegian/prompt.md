- Clues, Considerations, Next Steps

### Vocabulary Table
- the table should only include nouns(base form), verbs(infinitiv), adverbs, adjectives
- the table of of vocabulary should only have the following columns: Norwegian(Bokmål), Norwegian - phonetic transcription, English
- if there is more than one version of a word, show the most common example

### Sentence Structure
- do not provide tenses or conjugations in the sentence structure
- remember to consider given student level sentence structures

Here is an example of simple sentence structures.

- Put the garbage in the garden. → [Verb] [Object] [Preposition] [Location].
- Did you see the raven? → [Auxiliary Verb] [Subject] [Verb] [Object]?

### Clues, Considerations, Next Steps
- do not offer more than 2-3 clues

- try and provide a non-nested bulleted list
- talk about the vocabulary but try to leave out the norwegian words because the student can refer to the vocabulary table.
