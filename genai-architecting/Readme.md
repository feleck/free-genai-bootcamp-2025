## Functional Requirements

The company wants to own the infrastructure, because of concern of students privacy (users data) and expected high cost of managed services for GenAI.
They are ready to invest 10-15K in AI PC.

They have 300 active students, and students are located within the city of Nagasaki.

## Assumptions

We are assuming that choosen open-source LLMs will be powerful enough to run on owned hardware.
We are going to hook up a single server in our office to the internet and we shoud have enough bandwidth to serve 300 students.

## Data Strategy

There is a concern  of copyrighted materials, so we must purchase materials and store them for access in Datebase.
We must ensure the quality of data and adjust the materials to the level of students knowledge.
We have to implement adequate repetition (Spaced Repetition?) periods to improve language retention.
We have to be sure that we have the copyrights to the provided to students materials, and the students input does not violate (abuse) any rules and regulations.

## Considerations

We are considering using IBM Granite because it is truly open-source model with training data that is traceable so we can avoid any copyright issues and we know the insides of the model.
